# arduino-sumo-robot
The code of my 2017 sumo robot, using an arduino nano, two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, two TCS3200 color sensors and a L298N motor controller.

Honestly the robot didn't do that well in the competition because it was too light, but the electronics and programming were pretty good.
